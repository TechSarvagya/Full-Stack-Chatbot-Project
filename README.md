# Full-Stack-Chatbot-Project
This is a simple chatbot app built with React as Frontend and Django as Backend.
You can type in English, Hindi, or Hinglish, and the chatbot will try to understand and respond.

ðŸ‘‰ If you ever get confused about what to ask, just type:
"What all can I do"

When you do that, the bot will show you a list of example queries like:

Open YouTube, Google, Instagram, etc.

Tell me a joke, motivational quote, or fun fact.

Answer questions like "What is AI?" or "Who is the Prime Minister of India?"

Speak in Hindi, English, or Hinglish.

Send WhatsApp messages (if configured in backend).

Show time, date, or weather.

The chatbot also has a small typing animation (three dots) to make it look alive while it thinks.

Thatâ€™s all you need to know. Just start typing and enjoy.
